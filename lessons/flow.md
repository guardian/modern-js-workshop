## 1. What is Flow?

According to Flow's site:

> Flow is a static type checker for javascript


<! -- What does Flow give us? -->

## 2. Getting started

Let's start by cloning the repository in your local computer. Then, checkout the branch called `babel-solution`, this will be our starting point. In order to use Flow, you will need to setup the compiler in the project and install the client which runs the checker.

### Setup the compiler

The compiler is needed to **remove Flow types from the codebase**. It is possible to choose between `Babel` and a small CLI tool called `flow-remove-types`. 

We are going to install it via Babel.

#### 1. Install babel-preset-flow
Install [`babel-preset-flow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-flow) by executing the following `yarn` command:  

```
yarn add --dev @babel/preset-flow
```

If you are using `npm` the analogous command is:

```
npm install --dev @babel/preset-flow
```

Note that we are using the [scope package](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) `@babel/preset-flow` and not the classic `babel-preset-flow`.

#### 2. Modify `.babelrc`

Go to the root of the project and open the file `.babelrc`. Inside, add Flow as a preset. The final version should look like the following file:

```
{
  "presets": ["@babel/env", "@babel/preset-flow"],
  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Compiling JS files 

Now every time we run `babel`, it will also know how to remove Flow type annotations. In order to run babel we are going to use the command defined during the first session of these workshops:

```
yarn babel
```

### Setup Flow client

In order to run the flow type validation we need to setup the Flow client.

#### 1. Install flow-bin

Install [flow-bin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-bin) by running the following command using yarn:

```
yarn add --dev flow-bin
```

If you are using npm run the following command:

```
npm install --dev flow-bin
```

#### 2. Run the Flow checker

The first time we need initialise Flow by running:

```
yarn run flow init
```
The command above will create a `.flowconfig` in the root of the project. If you would like to know more about which kind of configuration you can specify, please [read the docs](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/).

Now we can run the Flow Background Process:

```
yarn flow
```

The output of this command should look like the following:

```
yarn run v1.2.1
$ /.../modern-js-workshop/node_modules/.bin/flow
No errors!
âœ¨  Done in 0.23s.
```

Congratulations, you are ready to develop using Flow ðŸš€.

### Prepare your files for Flow 

In order to tell the compiler which file it should check, you need to mark it as a Flow file by placing the following line at the top of the file:

```js
// @flow
```

Then the compiler will analise all these files at compile time to ensure consistency across the type definitions.
